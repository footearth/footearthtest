<h4 class="appendixsubsec">B.2.3 The Configuration Process</h4>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-configuring-1909"></a>This section is of interest only if you know something about using the
C language and the Unix operating system.

   <p>The source code for <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> generally attempts to adhere to formal
standards wherever possible.  This means that <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> uses library
routines that are specified by the ISO C standard and by the POSIX
operating system interface standard.  When using an ISO C compiler,
function prototypes are used to help improve the compile-time checking.

   <p>Many Unix systems do not support all of either the ISO or the
POSIX standards.  The <samp><span class="file">missing_d</span></samp> subdirectory in the <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>
distribution contains replacement versions of those functions that are
most likely to be missing.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp> file that <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> creates contains
definitions that describe features of the particular operating system
where you are attempting to compile <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>.  The three things
described by this file are: what header files are available, so that
they can be correctly included, what (supposedly) standard functions
are actually available in your C libraries, and various miscellaneous
facts about your variant of Unix.  For example, there may not be an
<code>st_blksize</code> element in the <code>stat</code> structure.  In this case,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">HAVE_ST_BLKSIZE</span></samp>&rsquo; is undefined.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcustom_002eh_007d-file-1910"></a>It is possible for your C compiler to lie to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>. It may
do so by not exiting with an error when a library function is not
available.  To get around this, edit the file <samp><span class="file">custom.h</span></samp>. 
Use an &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#ifdef</span></samp>&rsquo; that is appropriate for your system, and either
<code>#define</code> any constants that <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> should have defined but
didn't, or <code>#undef</code> any constants that <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> defined and
should not have.  <samp><span class="file">custom.h</span></samp> is automatically included by
<samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp>.

   <p>It is also possible that the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> program generated by
<samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp> will not work on your system in some other fashion. 
If you do have a problem, the file <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp> is the input for
<samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp>.  You may be able to change this file and generate a
new version of <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> that works on your system
(see <a href="Bugs.html#Bugs">Bugs</a>,
for information on how to report problems in configuring <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>). 
The same mechanism may be used to send in updates to <samp><span class="file">configure.in</span></samp>
and/or <samp><span class="file">custom.h</span></samp>.
