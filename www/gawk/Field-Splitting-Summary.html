<h4 class="subsection">3.5.4 Field-Splitting Summary</h4>

<p>It is important to remember that when you assign a string constant
as the value of <code>FS</code>, it undergoes normal <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> string
processing.  For example, with Unix <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>,
the assignment &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FS = "\.."</span></samp>&rsquo; assigns the character string <code>".."</code>
to <code>FS</code> (the backslash is stripped).  This creates a regexp meaning
&ldquo;fields are separated by occurrences of any two characters.&rdquo;
If instead you want fields to be separated by a literal period followed
by any single character, use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FS = "\\.."</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The following table summarizes how fields are split, based on the value
of <code>FS</code> (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">==</span></samp>&rsquo; means &ldquo;is equal to&rdquo;):

     <dl>
<dt><code>FS == " "</code><dd>Fields are separated by runs of whitespace.  Leading and trailing
whitespace are ignored.  This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>FS == </code><var>any other single character</var><dd>Fields are separated by each occurrence of the character.  Multiple
successive occurrences delimit empty fields, as do leading and
trailing occurrences. 
The character can even be a regexp metacharacter; it does not need
to be escaped.

     <br><dt><code>FS == </code><var>regexp</var><dd>Fields are separated by occurrences of characters that match <var>regexp</var>. 
Leading and trailing matches of <var>regexp</var> delimit empty fields.

     <br><dt><code>FS == ""</code><dd>Each individual character in the record becomes a separate field. 
(This is a <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> extension; it is not specified by the
POSIX standard.)

<h4 class="subheading">Advanced Notes: Changing <code>FS</code> Does Not Affect the Fields</h4>

<p><a name="index-POSIX-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-field-separators-and-436"></a><a name="index-field-separators_002c-POSIX-and-437"></a>According to the POSIX standard, <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> is supposed to behave
as if each record is split into fields at the time it is read. 
In particular, this means that if you change the value of <code>FS</code>
after a record is read, the value of the fields (i.e., how they were split)
should reflect the old value of <code>FS</code>, not the new one.

   <p><a name="index-dark-corner_002c-field-separators-438"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bsed_007d-utility-439"></a><a name="index-stream-editors-440"></a>However, many implementations of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> do not work this way.  Instead,
they defer splitting the fields until a field is actually
referenced.  The fields are split
using the <em>current</em> value of <code>FS</code>! 
(d.c.) 
This behavior can be difficult
to diagnose. The following example illustrates the difference
between the two methods. 
(The <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
command prints just the first line of <samp><span class="file">/etc/passwd</span></samp>.)

<pre class="example">     sed 1q /etc/passwd | awk '{ FS = ":" ; print $1 }'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which usually prints:

<pre class="example">     root
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">on an incorrect implementation of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>, while <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>
prints something like:

<pre class="example">     root:nSijPlPhZZwgE:0:0:Root:/:
</pre>

<h4 class="subheading">Advanced Notes: <code>FS</code> and <code>IGNORECASE</code></h4>

<p>The <code>IGNORECASE</code> variable
(see <a href="User_002dmodified.html#User_002dmodified">User-modified</a>)
affects field splitting <em>only</em> when the value of <code>FS</code> is a regexp. 
It has no effect when <code>FS</code> is a single character, even if
that character is a letter.  Thus, in the following code:

<pre class="example">     FS = "c"
     IGNORECASE = 1
     $0 = "aCa"
     print $1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The output is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aCa</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you really want to split fields on an
alphabetic character while ignoring case, use a regexp that will
do it for you.  E.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FS = "[c]"</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In this case, <code>IGNORECASE</code>
will take effect.

Its behavior is also defined by the POSIX standard.</p>
