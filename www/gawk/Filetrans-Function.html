<h4 class="subsection">12.3.1 Noting Data File Boundaries</h4>

<p><a name="index-files_002c-managing_002c-_0040value_007bDF_007d-boundaries-1680"></a><a name="index-files_002c-initialization-and-cleanup-1681"></a>The <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules are each executed exactly once at
the beginning and end of your <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program, respectively
(see <a href="BEGIN_002fEND.html#BEGIN_002fEND">BEGIN/END</a>). 
We (the <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> authors) once had a user who mistakenly thought that the
<code>BEGIN</code> rule is executed at the beginning of each data file and the
<code>END</code> rule is executed at the end of each data file.  When informed
that this was not the case, the user requested that we add new special
patterns to <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>, named <code>BEGIN_FILE</code> and <code>END_FILE</code>, that
would have the desired behavior.  He even supplied us the code to do so.

   <p>Adding these special patterns to <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> wasn't necessary;
the job can be done cleanly in <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> itself, as illustrated
by the following library program. 
It arranges to call two user-supplied functions, <code>beginfile</code> and
<code>endfile</code>, at the beginning and end of each data file. 
Besides solving the problem in only nine(!) lines of code, it does so
<em>portably</em>; this works with any implementation of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     # transfile.awk
     #
     # Give the user a hook for filename transitions
     #
     # The user must supply functions beginfile() and endfile()
     # that each take the name of the file being started or
     # finished, respectively.
     <!-- # -->
     <!-- # Arnold Robbins, arnold@@skeeve.com, Public Domain -->
     <!-- # January 1992 -->
     
     FILENAME != _oldfilename \
     {
         if (_oldfilename != "")
             endfile(_oldfilename)
         _oldfilename = FILENAME
         beginfile(FILENAME)
     }
     
     END   { endfile(FILENAME) }
</pre>
   <p>This file must be loaded before the user's &ldquo;main&rdquo; program, so that the
rule it supplies is executed first.

   <p>This rule relies on <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>'s <code>FILENAME</code> variable that
automatically changes for each new data file.  The current file name is
saved in a private variable, <code>_oldfilename</code>.  If <code>FILENAME</code> does
not equal <code>_oldfilename</code>, then a new data file is being processed and
it is necessary to call <code>endfile</code> for the old file.  Because
<code>endfile</code> should only be called if a file has been processed, the
program first checks to make sure that <code>_oldfilename</code> is not the null
string.  The program then assigns the current file name to
<code>_oldfilename</code> and calls <code>beginfile</code> for the file. 
Because, like all <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> variables, <code>_oldfilename</code> is
initialized to the null string, this rule executes correctly even for the
first data file.

   <p>The program also supplies an <code>END</code> rule to do the final processing for
the last file.  Because this <code>END</code> rule comes before any <code>END</code> rules
supplied in the &ldquo;main&rdquo; program, <code>endfile</code> is called first.  Once
again the value of multiple <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules should be clear.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bbeginfile_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1682"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bendfile_007d-user_002ddefined-function-1683"></a>This version has same problem as the first version of <code>nextfile</code>
(see <a href="Nextfile-Function.html#Nextfile-Function">Nextfile Function</a>). 
If the same data file occurs twice in a row on the command line, then
<code>endfile</code> and <code>beginfile</code> are not executed at the end of the
first pass and at the beginning of the second pass. 
The following version solves the problem:

<pre class="example">     <!-- file eg/lib/ftrans.awk -->
     # ftrans.awk --- handle data file transitions
     #
     # user supplies beginfile() and endfile() functions
     <!-- endfile -->
     <!-- file eg/lib/ftrans.awk -->
     FNR == 1 {
         if (_filename_ != "")
             endfile(_filename_)
         _filename_ = FILENAME
         beginfile(FILENAME)
     }
     
     END  { endfile(_filename_) }
     <!-- endfile -->
</pre>

shows how this library function can be used and
how it simplifies writing the main program.
