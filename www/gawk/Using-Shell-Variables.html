<h3 class="section">6.2 Using Shell Variables in Programs</h3>

<p><a name="index-shells_002c-variables-933"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-shell-variables-in-934"></a><!-- @cindex shell and @command{awk} interaction -->

   <p><samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs are often used as components in larger
programs written in shell. 
For example, it is very common to use a shell variable to
hold a pattern that the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program searches for. 
There are two ways to get the value of the shell variable
into the body of the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program.

   <p><a name="index-shells_002c-quoting-935"></a>The most common method is to use shell quoting to substitute
the variable's value into the program inside the script. 
For example, in the following program:

<pre class="example">     echo -n "Enter search pattern: "
     read pattern
     awk "/$pattern/ "'{ nmatches++ }
          END { print nmatches, "found" }' /path/to/data
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program consists of two pieces of quoted text
that are concatenated together to form the program. 
The first part is double-quoted, which allows substitution of
the <code>pattern</code> variable inside the quotes. 
The second part is single-quoted.

   <p>Variable substitution via quoting works, but can be potentially
messy.  It requires a good understanding of the shell's quoting rules
(see <a href="Quoting.html#Quoting">Quoting</a>),
and it's often difficult to correctly
match up the quotes when reading the program.

   <p>A better method is to use <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>'s variable assignment feature
(see <a href="Assignment-Options.html#Assignment-Options">Assignment Options</a>)
to assign the shell variable's value to an <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> variable's
value.  Then use dynamic regexps to match the pattern
(see <a href="Computed-Regexps.html#Computed-Regexps">Computed Regexps</a>). 
The following shows how to redo the
previous example using this technique:

<pre class="example">     echo -n "Enter search pattern: "
     read pattern
     awk -v pat="$pattern" '$0 ~ pat { nmatches++ }
            END { print nmatches, "found" }' /path/to/data
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now, the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program is just one single-quoted string. 
The assignment &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-v pat="$pattern"</span></samp>&rsquo; still requires double quotes,
in case there is whitespace in the value of <code>$pattern</code>. 
The <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> variable <code>pat</code> could be named <code>pattern</code>
too, but that would be more confusing.  Using a variable also
provides more flexibility, since the variable can be used anywhere inside
the program&mdash;for printing, as an array subscript, or for any other
use&mdash;without requiring the quoting tricks at every point in the program.
