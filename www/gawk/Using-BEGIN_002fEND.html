<h5 class="subsubsection">6.1.4.1 Startup and Cleanup Actions</h5>

<p>A <code>BEGIN</code> rule is executed once only, before the first input record
is read. Likewise, an <code>END</code> rule is executed once only, after all the
input is read.  For example:

<pre class="example">     $ awk '
     &gt; BEGIN { print "Analysis of \"foo\"" }
     &gt; /foo/ { ++n }
     &gt; END   { print "\"foo\" appears", n, "times." }' BBS-list
     -| Analysis of "foo"
     -| "foo" appears 4 times.
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bBEGIN_007d-pattern_002c-operators-and-919"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bEND_007d-pattern_002c-operators-and-920"></a>This program finds the number of records in the input file <samp><span class="file">BBS-list</span></samp>
that contain the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The <code>BEGIN</code> rule prints a title
for the report.  There is no need to use the <code>BEGIN</code> rule to
initialize the counter <code>n</code> to zero, since <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> does this
automatically (see <a href="Variables.html#Variables">Variables</a>). 
The second rule increments the variable <code>n</code> every time a
record containing the pattern &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; is read.  The <code>END</code> rule
prints the value of <code>n</code> at the end of the run.

   <p>The special patterns <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> cannot be used in ranges
or with Boolean operators (indeed, they cannot be used with any operators). 
An <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program may have multiple <code>BEGIN</code> and/or <code>END</code>
rules.  They are executed in the order in which they appear: all the <code>BEGIN</code>
rules at startup and all the <code>END</code> rules at termination. 
<code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules may be intermixed with other rules. 
This feature was added in the 1987 version of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> and is included
in the POSIX standard. 
The original (1978) version of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>
required the <code>BEGIN</code> rule to be placed at the beginning of the
program, the <code>END</code> rule to be placed at the end, and only allowed one of
each. 
This is no longer required, but it is a good idea to follow this template
in terms of program organization and readability.

   <p>Multiple <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules are useful for writing
library functions, because each library file can have its own <code>BEGIN</code> and/or
<code>END</code> rule to do its own initialization and/or cleanup. 
The order in which library functions are named on the command line
controls the order in which their <code>BEGIN</code> and <code>END</code> rules are
executed.  Therefore, you have to be careful when writing such rules in
library files so that the order in which they are executed doesn't matter. 
See <a href="Options.html#Options">Options</a>, for more information on
using library functions. 
See <a href="Library-Functions.html#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>,
for a number of useful library functions.

   <p>If an <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program has only a <code>BEGIN</code> rule and no
other rules, then the program exits after the <code>BEGIN</code> rule is
run.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  However, if an
<code>END</code> rule exists, then the input is read, even if there are
no other rules in the program.  This is necessary in case the <code>END</code>
rule checks the <code>FNR</code> and <code>NR</code> variables.
