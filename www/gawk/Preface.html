<h2 class="unnumbered">Preface</h2>

<!-- I saw a comment somewhere that the preface should describe the book itself, -->
<!-- and the introduction should describe what the book covers. -->
<!-- 12/2000: Chuck wants the preface & intro combined. -->
<p>Several kinds of tasks occur repeatedly
when working with text files. 
You might want to extract certain lines and discard the rest. 
Or you may need to make changes wherever certain patterns appear,
but leave the rest of the file alone. 
Writing single-use programs for these tasks in languages such as C, C++, or Pascal
is time-consuming and inconvenient. 
Such jobs are often easier with <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>. 
The <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> utility interprets a special-purpose programming language
that makes it easy to handle simple data-reformatting jobs.

   <p>The GNU implementation of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> is called <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>; it is fully
compatible with the System V Release 4 version of
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>.  <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> is also compatible with the POSIX
specification of the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language.  This means that all
properly written <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs should work with <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>. 
Thus, we usually don't distinguish between <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> and other
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> implementations.

     <ul>
<li>Manage small, personal databases

     <li>Generate reports

     <li>Validate data

     <li>Produce indexes and perform other document preparation tasks

     <li>Experiment with algorithms that you can adapt later to other computer
languages
</ul>

<samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>
provides facilities that make it easy to:

     <ul>
<li>Extract bits and pieces of data for processing

     <li>Sort data

     <li>Perform simple network communications
</ul>

   <p>This Web page teaches you about the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language and
how you can use it effectively.  You should already be familiar with basic
system commands, such as <samp><span class="command">cat</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp>,<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> as well as basic shell
facilities, such as input/output (I/O) redirection and pipes.

   <p><a name="index-GNU-_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-See-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-10"></a>Implementations of the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language are available for many
different computing environments.  This Web page, while describing
the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language in general, also describes the particular
implementation of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> called <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> (which stands for
&ldquo;GNU awk&rdquo;).  <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> runs on a broad range of Unix systems,
ranging from 80386 PC-based computers up through large-scale systems,
such as Crays. <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> has also been ported to Mac OS X,
MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows (all versions) and OS/2 PCs, Atari and Amiga
microcomputers, BeOS, Tandem D20, and VMS.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> These commands
are available on POSIX-compliant systems, as well as on traditional
Unix-based systems. If you are using some other operating system, you still need to
be familiar with the ideas of I/O redirection and pipes.</p>
