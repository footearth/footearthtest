<h5 class="appendixsubsubsec">B.3.3.3 Compiling <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> For Dynamic Libraries</h5>

<!-- From README_d/README.pcdynamic -->
<!-- 11 June 2003 -->
<p>To compile <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> with dynamic extension support,
uncomment the definitions of <code>DYN_FLAGS</code>, <code>DYN_EXP</code>,
<code>DYN_OBJ</code>, and <code>DYN_MAKEXP</code> in the configuration section of
the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>. There are two definitions for <code>DYN_MAKEXP</code>:
pick the one that matches your target.

   <p>To build some of the example extension libraries, <samp><span class="command">cd</span></samp> to the
extension directory and copy <samp><span class="file">Makefile.pc</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>. You
can then build using the same two targets. To run the example
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> scripts, you'll need to either change the call to
the <code>extension</code> function to match the name of the library (for
instance, change <code>"./ordchr.so"</code> to <code>"ordchr.dll"</code> or simply
<code>"ordchr"</code>), or rename the library to match the call (for instance,
rename <samp><span class="file">ordchr.dll</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">ordchr.so</span></samp>).

   <p>If you build <samp><span class="command">gawk.exe</span></samp> with one compiler but want to build
an extension library with the other, you need to copy the import
library. Visual C uses a library called <samp><span class="file">gawk.lib</span></samp>, while MinGW uses
a library called <samp><span class="file">libgawk.a</span></samp>. These files are equivalent and will
interoperate if you give them the correct name.  The resulting shared
libraries are also interoperable.

   <p>To create your own extension library, you can use the examples as models,
but you're essentially on your own. Post to <code>comp.lang.awk</code> or
send electronic mail to <a href="mailto:ptjm@interlog.com">ptjm@interlog.com</a> if you have problems getting
started. If you need to access functions or variables which are not
exported by <samp><span class="command">gawk.exe</span></samp>, add them to <samp><span class="file">gawkw32.def</span></samp> and
rebuild. You should also add <code>ATTRIBUTE_EXPORTED</code> to the declaration
in <samp><span class="file">awk.h</span></samp> of any variables you add to <samp><span class="file">gawkw32.def</span></samp>.

   <p>Note that extension libraries have the name of the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>
executable embedded in them at link time, so they will work only
with <samp><span class="command">gawk.exe</span></samp>. In particular, they won't work if you
rename <samp><span class="command">gawk.exe</span></samp> to <samp><span class="command">awk.exe</span></samp> or if you try to use
<samp><span class="command">pgawk.exe</span></samp>. You can perform profiling by temporarily renaming
<samp><span class="command">pgawk.exe</span></samp> to <samp><span class="command">gawk.exe</span></samp>. You can resolve this problem
by changing the program name in the definition of <code>DYN_MAKEXP</code>
for your compiler.

   <p>On Windows32, libraries are sought first in the current directory, then in
the directory containing <samp><span class="command">gawk.exe</span></samp>, and finally through the
<samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> environment variable.
