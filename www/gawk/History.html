   <blockquote>
Blend all parts well using <code>lex</code> and <code>yacc</code>. 
Document minimally and release.

   <p>After eight years, add another part <code>egrep</code> and two
more parts C.  Document very well and release.

Aho, Peter J. Weinberger and Brian W. Kernighan.  The original version of
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> was written in 1977 at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. 
In 1985, a new version made the programming
language more powerful, introducing user-defined functions, multiple input
streams, and computed regular expressions. 
This new version became widely available with Unix System V
Release 3.1 (SVR3.1). 
The version in SVR4 added some new features and cleaned
up the behavior in some of the &ldquo;dark corners&rdquo; of the language. 
The specification for <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> in the POSIX Command Language
and Utilities standard further clarified the language. 
Both the <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> designers and the original Bell Laboratories <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>
designers provided feedback for the POSIX specification.

Jay Fenlason completed it, with advice from Richard Stallman.  John Woods
contributed parts of the code as well.  In 1988 and 1989, David Trueman, with
help from me, thoroughly reworked <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> for compatibility
with the newer <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>. 
Circa 1995, I became the primary maintainer. 
Current development focuses on bug fixes,
performance improvements, standards compliance, and occasionally, new features.

   <p>In May of 1997, J&uuml;rgen Kahrs felt the need for network access
from <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>, and with a little help from me, set about adding
features to do this for <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>.  At that time, he also
wrote the bulk of
<cite>TCP/IP Internetworking with </cite><samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>
(a separate document, available as part of the <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> distribution). 
His code finally became part of the main <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> distribution
with <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> version 3.1.
