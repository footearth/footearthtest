<h3 class="section">Typographical Conventions</h3>

<p><a name="index-Texinfo-28"></a>This Web page is written using Texinfo, the GNU documentation
formatting language. 
A single Texinfo source file is used to produce both the printed and online
versions of the documentation. 
Because of this, the typographical conventions
are slightly different than in other books you may have read.

   <p>Examples you would type at the command-line are preceded by the common
shell primary and secondary prompts, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Output from the command is preceded by the glyph &ldquo;-|&rdquo;. 
This typically represents the command's standard output. 
Error messages, and other output on the command's standard error, are preceded
by the glyph &ldquo;error--&gt;&rdquo;.  For example:

<pre class="example">     $ echo hi on stdout
     -| hi on stdout
     $ echo hello on stderr 1&gt;&amp;2
     error--&gt; hello on stderr
</pre>
   <p>In the text, command names appear in <code>this font</code>, while code segments
appear in the same font and quoted, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">like this</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Some things are
emphasized <em>like this</em>, and if a point needs to be made
strongly, it is done <strong>like this</strong>.  The first occurrence of
a new term is usually its <dfn>definition</dfn> and appears in the same
font as the previous occurrence of &ldquo;definition&rdquo; in this sentence. 
file names are indicated like this: <samp><span class="file">/path/to/ourfile</span></samp>.

   <p>Characters that you type at the keyboard look <kbd>like this</kbd>.  In particular,
there are special characters called &ldquo;control characters.&rdquo;  These are
characters that you type by holding down both the <kbd>CONTROL</kbd> key and
another key, at the same time.  For example, a <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd> is typed
by first pressing and holding the <kbd>CONTROL</kbd> key, next
pressing the <kbd>d</kbd> key and finally releasing both keys.

<h5 class="subsubheading">Dark Corners</h5>

<p><a name="index-Kernighan_002c-Brian-29"></a><blockquote>
<i>Dark corners are basically fractal &mdash; no matter how much
you illuminate, there's always a smaller but darker one.</i><br>
Brian Kernighan
</blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-d_002ec_002e_002c-See-dark-corner-30"></a><a name="index-dark-corner-31"></a>Until the POSIX standard (and <cite>The Gawk Manual</cite>),
many features of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> were either poorly documented or not
documented at all.  Descriptions of such features
(often called &ldquo;dark corners&rdquo;) are noted in this Web page with
&ldquo;(d.c.)&rdquo;. 
They also appear in the index under the heading &ldquo;dark corner.&rdquo;

   <p>As noted by the opening quote, though, any
coverage of dark corners
is, by definition, something that is incomplete.
