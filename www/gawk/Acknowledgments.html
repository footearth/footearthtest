<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>The initial draft of <cite>The GAWK Manual</cite> had the following acknowledgments:

   <blockquote>
Many people need to be thanked for their assistance in producing this
manual.  Jay Fenlason contributed many ideas and sample programs.  Richard
Mlynarik and Robert Chassell gave helpful comments on drafts of this
manual.  The paper <cite>A Supplemental Document for </cite><samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> by John W. 
Pierce of the Chemistry Department at UC San Diego, pinpointed several
issues relevant both to <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> implementation and to this manual, that
would otherwise have escaped us. 
</blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-Stallman_002c-Richard-44"></a>I would like to acknowledge Richard M. Stallman, for his vision of a
better world and for his courage in founding the FSF and starting the
GNU Project.

Robert J. Chassell provided much valuable advice on
the use of Texinfo. 
He also deserves special thanks for
convincing me <em>not</em> to title this Web page
<cite>How To Gawk Politely</cite>. 
Karl Berry helped significantly with the TeX part of Texinfo.

   <p><a name="index-Hartholz_002c-Marshall-47"></a><a name="index-Hartholz_002c-Elaine-48"></a><a name="index-Schreiber_002c-Bert-49"></a><a name="index-Schreiber_002c-Rita-50"></a>I would like to thank Marshall and Elaine Hartholz of Seattle and
Dr. Bert and Rita Schreiber of Detroit for large amounts of quiet vacation
time in their homes, which allowed me to make significant progress on
this Web page and on <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> itself.

   <p><a name="index-Hughes_002c-Phil-51"></a>Phil Hughes of SSC
contributed in a very important way by loaning me his laptop GNU/Linux
system, not once, but twice, which allowed me to do a lot of work while
away from home.

   <p><a name="index-Trueman_002c-David-52"></a>David Trueman deserves special credit; he has done a yeoman job
of evolving <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> so that it performs well and without bugs. 
Although he is no longer involved with <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>,
working with him on this project was a significant pleasure.

   <p><a name="index-Drepper_002c-Ulrich-53"></a><a name="index-GNITS-mailing-list-54"></a><a name="index-mailing-list_002c-GNITS-55"></a>The intrepid members of the GNITS mailing list, and most notably Ulrich
Drepper, provided invaluable help and feedback for the design of the
internationalization features.

make up the
<samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> &ldquo;crack portability team.&rdquo;  Without their hard work and
help, <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> would not be nearly the fine program it is today.  It
has been and continues to be a pleasure working with this team of fine
people.

   <p><a name="index-Kernighan_002c-Brian-66"></a>David and I would like to thank Brian Kernighan of Bell Laboratories for
invaluable assistance during the testing and debugging of <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>, and for
help in clarifying numerous points about the language.  We could not have
done nearly as good a job on either <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> or its documentation without
his help.

   <p>Chuck Toporek, Mary Sheehan, and Claire Coutier of O'Reilly &amp; Associates contributed
significant editorial help for this Web page for the
3.1 release of <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-Robbins_002c-Miriam-67"></a><a name="index-Robbins_002c-Jean-68"></a><a name="index-Robbins_002c-Harry-69"></a><a name="index-G_002dd-70"></a>I must thank my wonderful wife, Miriam, for her patience through
the many versions of this project, for her proofreading,
and for sharing me with the computer. 
I would like to thank my parents for their love, and for the grace with
which they raised and educated me. 
Finally, I also must acknowledge my gratitude to G-d, for the many opportunities
He has sent my way, as well as for the gifts He has given me with which to
take advantage of those opportunities.
