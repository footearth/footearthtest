<p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-new-vs_002e_0040_003a-old-20"></a>The <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language has evolved over the years. Full details are
provided in <a href="Language-History.html#Language-History">Language History</a>. 
The language described in this Web page
is often referred to as &ldquo;new <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>&rdquo; (<samp><span class="command">nawk</span></samp>).

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-versions-of-21"></a>Because of this, many systems have multiple
versions of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>. 
Some systems have an <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> utility that implements the
original version of the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language and a <samp><span class="command">nawk</span></samp> utility
for the new
version. 
Others have an <samp><span class="command">oawk</span></samp> version for the &ldquo;old <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>&rdquo;
language and plain <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> for the new one.  Still others only
have one version, which is usually the new one.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bnawk_007d-utility-22"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007boawk_007d-utility-23"></a>All in all, this makes it difficult for you to know which version of
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> you should run when writing your programs.  The best advice
I can give here is to check your local documentation. Look for <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">oawk</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="command">nawk</span></samp>, as well as for <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>. 
It is likely that you already
have some version of new <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> on your system, which is what
you should use when running your programs.  (Of course, if you're reading
this Web page, chances are good that you have <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>!)

   <p>Throughout this Web page, whenever we refer to a language feature
that should be available in any complete implementation of POSIX <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>,
we simply use the term <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>.  When referring to a feature that is
specific to the GNU implementation, we use the term <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Often, these systems
use <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> for their <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> implementation!</p>
