<h3 class="section">1.8 When to Use <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp></h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-uses-for-165"></a>Now that you've seen some of what <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> can do,
you might wonder how <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> could be useful for you.  By using
utility programs, advanced patterns, field separators, arithmetic
statements, and other selection criteria, you can produce much more
complex output.  The <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language is very useful for producing
reports from large amounts of raw data, such as summarizing information
from the output of other utility programs like <samp><span class="command">ls</span></samp>. 
(See <a href="More-Complex.html#More-Complex">More Complex</a>.)

   <p>Programs written with <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> are usually much smaller than they would
be in other languages.  This makes <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs easy to compose and
use.  Often, <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs can be quickly composed at your terminal,
used once, and thrown away.  Because <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs are interpreted, you
can avoid the (usually lengthy) compilation part of the typical
edit-compile-test-debug cycle of software development.

   <p>Complex programs have been written in <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>, including a complete
retargetable assembler for eight-bit microprocessors (see <a href="Glossary.html#Glossary">Glossary</a>, for
more information), and a microcode assembler for a special-purpose Prolog
computer.  More recently, <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> was used for writing a Wiki
clone.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
While the original <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>'s capabilities were strained by tasks
of such complexity, modern versions are more capable.  Even the Bell
Labs version of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> has fewer predefined limits, and those
that it has are much larger than they used to be.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-complex-166"></a>If you find yourself writing <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> scripts of more than, say, a few
hundred lines, you might consider using a different programming
language.  Emacs Lisp is a good choice if you need sophisticated string
or pattern matching capabilities.  The shell is also good at string and
pattern matching; in addition, it allows powerful use of the system
utilities.  More conventional languages, such as C, C++, and Java, offer
better facilities for system programming and for managing the complexity
of large programs.  Programs in these languages may require more lines
of source code than the equivalent <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs, but they are
easier to maintain and usually run more efficiently.
