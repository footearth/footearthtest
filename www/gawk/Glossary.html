<dt>Action<dd>A series of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> statements attached to a rule.  If the rule's
pattern matches an input record, <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> executes the
rule's action.  Actions are always enclosed in curly braces. 
(See <a href="Action-Overview.html#Action-Overview">Action Overview</a>.)

completely as <samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> scripts.  It is thousands
of lines long, including machine descriptions for several eight-bit
microcomputers.  It is a good example of a program that would have been
better written in another language. 
You can get it from <a href="ftp://ftp.freefriends.org/arnold/Awkstuff/aaa.tgz">ftp://ftp.freefriends.org/arnold/Awkstuff/aaa.tgz</a>.

a large subset of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nroff -ms</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nroff -man</span></samp>&rsquo; formatting
commands, using <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">sh</span></samp>. 
It is available over the Internet
from <a href="ftp://ftp.freefriends.org/arnold/Awkstuff/awf.tgz">ftp://ftp.freefriends.org/arnold/Awkstuff/awf.tgz</a>.

     <br><dt>Anchor<dd>The regexp metacharacters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, which force the match
to the beginning or end of the string, respectively.

     <p><a name="index-ANSI-2088"></a><br><dt>ANSI<dd>The American National Standards Institute.  This organization produces
many standards, among them the standards for the C and C++ programming
languages. 
These standards often become international standards as well. See also
&ldquo;ISO.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Array<dd>A grouping of multiple values under the same name. 
Most languages just provide sequential arrays. 
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> provides associative arrays.

     <br><dt>Assertion<dd>A statement in a program that a condition is true at this point in the program. 
Useful for reasoning about how a program is supposed to behave.

     <br><dt>Assignment<dd>An <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> expression that changes the value of some <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>
variable or data object.  An object that you can assign to is called an
<dfn>lvalue</dfn>.  The assigned values are called <dfn>rvalues</dfn>. 
See <a href="Assignment-Ops.html#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Ops</a>.

     <br><dt>Associative Array<dd>Arrays in which the indices may be numbers or strings, not just
sequential integers in a fixed range.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> Language<dd>The language in which <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs are written.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> Program<dd>An <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program consists of a series of <dfn>patterns</dfn> and
<dfn>actions</dfn>, collectively known as <dfn>rules</dfn>.  For each input record
given to the program, the program's rules are all processed in turn. 
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs may also contain function definitions.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> Script<dd>Another name for an <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program.

     <br><dt>Bash<dd>The GNU version of the standard shell
(the <b>B</b>ourne-<b>A</b>gain <b>SH</b>ell). 
See also &ldquo;Bourne Shell.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>BBS<dd>See &ldquo;Bulletin Board System.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Bit<dd>Short for &ldquo;Binary Digit.&rdquo;
All values in computer memory ultimately reduce to binary digits: values
that are either zero or one. 
Groups of bits may be interpreted differently&mdash;as integers,
floating-point numbers, character data, addresses of other
memory objects, or other data. 
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> lets you work with floating-point numbers and strings. 
<samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> lets you manipulate bit values with the built-in
functions described in
<a href="Bitwise-Functions.html#Bitwise-Functions">Bitwise Functions</a>.

     <p>Computers are often defined by how many bits they use to represent integer
values.  Typical systems are 32-bit systems, but 64-bit systems are
becoming increasingly popular, and 16-bit systems are waning in
popularity.

     <br><dt>Boolean Expression<dd>Named after the English mathematician Boole. See also &ldquo;Logical Expression.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Bourne Shell<dd>The standard shell (<samp><span class="file">/bin/sh</span></samp>) on Unix and Unix-like systems,
originally written by Steven R. Bourne. 
Many shells (<samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">ksh</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">pdksh</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">zsh</span></samp>) are
generally upwardly compatible with the Bourne shell.

     <br><dt>Built-in Function<dd>The <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language provides built-in functions that perform various
numerical, I/O-related, and string computations.  Examples are
<code>sqrt</code> (for the square root of a number) and <code>substr</code> (for a
substring of a string). 
<samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> provides functions for timestamp management, bit manipulation,
and runtime string translation. 
(See <a href="Built_002din.html#Built_002din">Built-in</a>.)

     <br><dt>Built-in Variable<dd><code>ARGC</code>,
<code>ARGV</code>,
<code>CONVFMT</code>,
<code>ENVIRON</code>,
<code>FILENAME</code>,
<code>FNR</code>,
<code>FS</code>,
<code>NF</code>,
<code>NR</code>,
<code>OFMT</code>,
<code>OFS</code>,
<code>ORS</code>,
<code>RLENGTH</code>,
<code>RSTART</code>,
<code>RS</code>,
and
<code>SUBSEP</code>
are the variables that have special meaning to <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>. 
In addition,
<code>ARGIND</code>,
<code>BINMODE</code>,
<code>ERRNO</code>,
<code>FIELDWIDTHS</code>,
<code>IGNORECASE</code>,
<code>LINT</code>,
<code>PROCINFO</code>,
<code>RT</code>,
and
<code>TEXTDOMAIN</code>
are the variables that have special meaning to <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>. 
Changing some of them affects <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>'s running environment. 
(See <a href="Built_002din-Variables.html#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>.)

     <br><dt>Braces<dd>See &ldquo;Curly Braces.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Bulletin Board System<dd>A computer system allowing users to log in and read and/or leave messages
for other users of the system, much like leaving paper notes on a bulletin
board.

     <br><dt>C<dd>The system programming language that most GNU software is written in.  The
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programming language has C-like syntax, and this Web page
points out similarities between <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> and C when appropriate.

     <p>In general, <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> attempts to be as similar to the 1990 version
of ISO C as makes sense.  Future versions of <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> may adopt features
from the newer 1999 standard, as appropriate.

     <br><dt>C++<dd>A popular object-oriented programming language derived from C.

     <p><a name="index-ISO-8859_002d1-2089"></a><a name="index-ISO-Latin_002d1-2090"></a><a name="index-character-sets-_0028machine-character-encodings_0029-2091"></a><br><dt>Character Set<dd>The set of numeric codes used by a computer system to represent the
characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, etc.) of a particular country
or place. The most common character set in use today is ASCII (American
Standard Code for Information Interchange).  Many European
countries use an extension of ASCII known as ISO-8859-1 (ISO Latin-1).

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bchem_007d-utility-2092"></a><br><dt>CHEM<dd>A preprocessor for <samp><span class="command">pic</span></samp> that reads descriptions of molecules
and produces <samp><span class="command">pic</span></samp> input for drawing them. 
It was written in <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>
by Brian Kernighan and Jon Bentley, and is available from
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/netlib/typesetting/chem.gz">http://cm.bell-labs.com/netlib/typesetting/chem.gz</a>.

     <br><dt>Coprocess<dd>A subordinate program with which two-way communications is possible.

     <p><a name="index-compiled-programs-2093"></a><br><dt>Compiler<dd>A program that translates human-readable source code into
machine-executable object code.  The object code is then executed
directly by the computer. 
See also &ldquo;Interpreter.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Compound Statement<dd>A series of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> statements, enclosed in curly braces.  Compound
statements may be nested. 
(See <a href="Statements.html#Statements">Statements</a>.)

     <br><dt>Concatenation<dd>Concatenating two strings means sticking them together, one after another,
producing a new string.  For example, the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo; concatenated with
the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">bar</span></samp>&rsquo; gives the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foobar</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
(See <a href="Concatenation.html#Concatenation">Concatenation</a>.)

     <br><dt>Conditional Expression<dd>An expression using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?:</span></samp>&rsquo; ternary operator, such as
&lsquo;<samp><var>expr1</var><span class="samp"> ? </span><var>expr2</var><span class="samp"> : </span><var>expr3</var></samp>&rsquo;.  The expression
<var>expr1</var> is evaluated; if the result is true, the value of the whole
expression is the value of <var>expr2</var>; otherwise the value is
<var>expr3</var>.  In either case, only one of <var>expr2</var> and <var>expr3</var>
is evaluated. (See <a href="Conditional-Exp.html#Conditional-Exp">Conditional Exp</a>.)

     <br><dt>Comparison Expression<dd>A relation that is either true or false, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(a &lt; b)</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Comparison expressions are used in <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>do</code>,
and <code>for</code>
statements, and in patterns to select which input records to process. 
(See <a href="Typing-and-Comparison.html#Typing-and-Comparison">Typing and Comparison</a>.)

     <br><dt>Curly Braces<dd>The characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Curly braces are used in
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> for delimiting actions, compound statements, and function
bodies.

     <p><a name="index-dark-corner-2094"></a><br><dt>Dark Corner<dd>An area in the language where specifications often were (or still
are) not clear, leading to unexpected or undesirable behavior. 
Such areas are marked in this Web page with
&ldquo;(d.c.)&rdquo; in the text
and are indexed under the heading &ldquo;dark corner.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Data Driven<dd>A description of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs, where you specify the data you
are interested in processing, and what to do when that data is seen.

     <br><dt>Data Objects<dd>These are numbers and strings of characters.  Numbers are converted into
strings and vice versa, as needed. 
(See <a href="Conversion.html#Conversion">Conversion</a>.)

     <br><dt>Deadlock<dd>The situation in which two communicating processes are each waiting
for the other to perform an action.

     <br><dt>Double-Precision<dd>An internal representation of numbers that can have fractional parts. 
Double-precision numbers keep track of more digits than do single-precision
numbers, but operations on them are sometimes more expensive.  This is the way
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> stores numeric values.  It is the C type <code>double</code>.

     <br><dt>Dynamic Regular Expression<dd>A dynamic regular expression is a regular expression written as an
ordinary expression.  It could be a string constant, such as
<code>"foo"</code>, but it may also be an expression whose value can vary. 
(See <a href="Computed-Regexps.html#Computed-Regexps">Computed Regexps</a>.)

     <br><dt>Environment<dd>A collection of strings, of the form <var>name</var><code>=</code><var>val</var>, that each
program has available to it. Users generally place values into the
environment in order to provide information to various programs. Typical
examples are the environment variables <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.

     <br><dt>Empty String<dd>See &ldquo;Null String.&rdquo;

     <p><a name="index-epoch_002c-definition-of-2095"></a><br><dt>Epoch<dd>The date used as the &ldquo;beginning of time&rdquo; for timestamps. 
Time values in Unix systems are represented as seconds since the epoch,
with library functions available for converting these values into
standard date and time formats.

     <p>The epoch on Unix and POSIX systems is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. 
See also &ldquo;GMT&rdquo; and &ldquo;UTC.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Escape Sequences<dd>A special sequence of characters used for describing nonprinting
characters, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\n</span></samp>&rsquo; for newline or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\033</span></samp>&rsquo; for the ASCII
ESC (Escape) character. (See <a href="Escape-Sequences.html#Escape-Sequences">Escape Sequences</a>.)

     <br><dt>FDL<dd>See &ldquo;Free Documentation License.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Field<dd>When <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> reads an input record, it splits the record into pieces
separated by whitespace (or by a separator regexp that you can
change by setting the built-in variable <code>FS</code>).  Such pieces are
called fields.  If the pieces are of fixed length, you can use the built-in
variable <code>FIELDWIDTHS</code> to describe their lengths. 
(See <a href="Field-Separators.html#Field-Separators">Field Separators</a>,
and
<a href="Constant-Size.html#Constant-Size">Constant Size</a>.)

     <br><dt>Flag<dd>A variable whose truth value indicates the existence or nonexistence
of some condition.

     <br><dt>Floating-Point Number<dd>Often referred to in mathematical terms as a &ldquo;rational&rdquo; or real number,
this is just a number that can have a fractional part. 
See also &ldquo;Double-Precision&rdquo; and &ldquo;Single-Precision.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Format<dd>Format strings are used to control the appearance of output in the
<code>strftime</code> and <code>sprintf</code> functions, and are used in the
<code>printf</code> statement as well.  Also, data conversions from numbers to strings
are controlled by the format string contained in the built-in variable
<code>CONVFMT</code>. (See <a href="Control-Letters.html#Control-Letters">Control Letters</a>.)

     <br><dt>Free Documentation License<dd>This document describes the terms under which this Web page
is published and may be copied. (See <a href="GNU-Free-Documentation-License.html#GNU-Free-Documentation-License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.)

     <br><dt>Function<dd>A specialized group of statements used to encapsulate general
or program-specific tasks.  <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> has a number of built-in
functions, and also allows you to define your own. 
(See <a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions</a>.)

     <br><dt>FSF<dd>See &ldquo;Free Software Foundation.&rdquo;

     <p><a name="index-FSF-_0028Free-Software-Foundation_0029-2096"></a><a name="index-Free-Software-Foundation-_0028FSF_0029-2097"></a><a name="index-Stallman_002c-Richard-2098"></a><br><dt>Free Software Foundation<dd>A nonprofit organization dedicated
to the production and distribution of freely distributable software. 
It was founded by Richard M. Stallman, the author of the original
Emacs editor.  GNU Emacs is the most widely used version of Emacs today.

     <p><a name="index-GPL-_0028General-Public-License_0029-2099"></a><a name="index-General-Public-License-_0028GPL_0029-2100"></a><a name="index-GNU-General-Public-License-2101"></a><br><dt>General Public License<dd>This document describes the terms under which <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> and its source
code may be distributed. (See <a href="Copying.html#Copying">Copying</a>.)

     <br><dt>GMT<dd>&ldquo;Greenwich Mean Time.&rdquo;
This is the old term for UTC. 
It is the time of day used as the epoch for Unix and POSIX systems. 
See also &ldquo;Epoch&rdquo; and &ldquo;UTC.&rdquo;

     <p><a name="index-FSF-_0028Free-Software-Foundation_0029-2102"></a><a name="index-Free-Software-Foundation-_0028FSF_0029-2103"></a><a name="index-GNU-Project-2104"></a><br><dt>GNU<dd>&ldquo;GNU's not Unix&rdquo;.  An on-going project of the Free Software Foundation
to create a complete, freely distributable, POSIX-compliant computing
environment.

     <br><dt>GNU/Linux<dd>A variant of the GNU system using the Linux kernel, instead of the
Free Software Foundation's Hurd kernel. 
Linux is a stable, efficient, full-featured clone of Unix that has
been ported to a variety of architectures. 
It is most popular on PC-class systems, but runs well on a variety of
other systems too. 
The Linux kernel source code is available under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, which is perhaps its most important aspect.

     <br><dt>GPL<dd>See &ldquo;General Public License.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Hexadecimal<dd>Base 16 notation, where the digits are <code>0</code>&ndash;<code>9</code> and
<code>A</code>&ndash;<code>F</code>, with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">A</span></samp>&rsquo;
representing 10, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>&rsquo; representing 11, and so on, up to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo; for 15. 
Hexadecimal numbers are written in C using a leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0x</span></samp>&rsquo;,
to indicate their base.  Thus, <code>0x12</code> is 18 (1 times 16 plus 2).

     <br><dt>I/O<dd>Abbreviation for &ldquo;Input/Output,&rdquo; the act of moving data into and/or
out of a running program.

     <br><dt>Input Record<dd>A single chunk of data that is read in by <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>.  Usually, an <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> input
record consists of one line of text.

     <br><dt>Integer<dd>A whole number, i.e., a number that does not have a fractional part.

     <br><dt>Internationalization<dd>The process of writing or modifying a program so
that it can use multiple languages without requiring
further source code changes.

     <p><a name="index-interpreted-programs-2105"></a><br><dt>Interpreter<dd>A program that reads human-readable source code directly, and uses
the instructions in it to process data and produce results. 
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> is typically (but not always) implemented as an interpreter. 
See also &ldquo;Compiler.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Interval Expression<dd>A component of a regular expression that lets you specify repeated matches of
some part of the regexp.  Interval expressions were not traditionally available
in <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs.

     <p><a name="index-ISO-2106"></a><br><dt>ISO<dd>The International Standards Organization. 
This organization produces international standards for many things, including
programming languages, such as C and C++. 
In the computer arena, important standards like those for C, C++, and POSIX
become both American national and ISO international standards simultaneously. 
This Web page refers to Standard C as &ldquo;ISO C&rdquo; throughout.

     <br><dt>Keyword<dd>In the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language, a keyword is a word that has special
meaning.  Keywords are reserved and may not be used as variable names.

Instead, they denote regular expression operations, such as repetition,
grouping, or alternation.

     <br><dt>Null String<dd>A string with no characters in it.  It is represented explicitly in
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs by placing two double quote characters next to
each other (<code>""</code>).  It can appear in input data by having two successive
occurrences of the field separator appear next to each other.

     <br><dt>Number<dd>A numeric-valued data object.  Modern <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> implementations use
double-precision floating-point to represent numbers. 
Very old <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> implementations use single-precision floating-point.

     <br><dt>Octal<dd>Base-eight notation, where the digits are <code>0</code>&ndash;<code>7</code>. 
Octal numbers are written in C using a leading &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo;,
to indicate their base.  Thus, <code>013</code> is 11 (one times 8 plus 3).

     <br><dt>Pattern<dd>Patterns tell <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> which input records are interesting to which
rules.

     <p>A pattern is an arbitrary conditional expression against which input is
tested.  If the condition is satisfied, the pattern is said to <dfn>match</dfn>
the input record.  A typical pattern might compare the input record against
a regular expression. (See <a href="Pattern-Overview.html#Pattern-Overview">Pattern Overview</a>.)

     <br><dt>POSIX<dd>The name for a series of standards
<!-- being developed by the IEEE -->
that specify a Portable Operating System interface.  The &ldquo;IX&rdquo; denotes
the Unix heritage of these standards.  The main standard of interest for
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> users is
<cite>IEEE Standard for Information Technology, Standard 1003.2-1992,
Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) Part 2: Shell and Utilities</cite>. 
Informally, this standard is often referred to as simply &ldquo;P1003.2.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Precedence<dd>The order in which operations are performed when operators are used
without explicit parentheses.

     <br><dt>Private<dd>Variables and/or functions that are meant for use exclusively by library
functions and not for the main <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program. Special care must be
taken when naming such variables and functions. 
(See <a href="Library-Names.html#Library-Names">Library Names</a>.)

     <br><dt>Range (of input lines)<dd>A sequence of consecutive lines from the input file(s).  A pattern
can specify ranges of input lines for <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> to process or it can
specify single lines. (See <a href="Pattern-Overview.html#Pattern-Overview">Pattern Overview</a>.)

     <br><dt>Recursion<dd>When a function calls itself, either directly or indirectly. 
If this isn't clear, refer to the entry for &ldquo;recursion.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Redirection<dd>Redirection means performing input from something other than the standard input
stream, or performing output to something other than the standard output stream.

     <p>You can redirect the output of the <code>print</code> and <code>printf</code> statements
to a file or a system command, using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;
operators.  You can redirect input to the <code>getline</code> statement using
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">|&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; operators. 
(See <a href="Redirection.html#Redirection">Redirection</a>,
and <a href="Getline.html#Getline">Getline</a>.)

     <br><dt>Regexp<dd>Short for <dfn>regular expression</dfn>.  A regexp is a pattern that denotes a
set of strings, possibly an infinite set.  For example, the regexp
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R.*xp</span></samp>&rsquo; matches any string starting with the letter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo;
and ending with the letters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xp</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>, regexps are
used in patterns and in conditional expressions.  Regexps may contain
escape sequences. (See <a href="Regexp.html#Regexp">Regexp</a>.)

     <br><dt>Regular Expression<dd>See &ldquo;regexp.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Regular Expression Constant<dd>A regular expression constant is a regular expression written within
slashes, such as <code>/foo/</code>.  This regular expression is chosen
when you write the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program and cannot be changed during
its execution. (See <a href="Regexp-Usage.html#Regexp-Usage">Regexp Usage</a>.)

     <br><dt>Rule<dd>A segment of an <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program that specifies how to process single
input records.  A rule consists of a <dfn>pattern</dfn> and an <dfn>action</dfn>. 
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> reads an input record; then, for each rule, if the input record
satisfies the rule's pattern, <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> executes the rule's action. 
Otherwise, the rule does nothing for that input record.

     <br><dt>Rvalue<dd>A value that can appear on the right side of an assignment operator. 
In <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>, essentially every expression has a value. These values
are rvalues.

     <br><dt>Scalar<dd>A single value, be it a number or a string. 
Regular variables are scalars; arrays and functions are not.

     <br><dt>Search Path<dd>In <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>, a list of directories to search for <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program source files. 
In the shell, a list of directories to search for executable programs.

     <br><dt>Seed<dd>The initial value, or starting point, for a sequence of random numbers.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp><dd>See &ldquo;Stream Editor.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Shell<dd>The command interpreter for Unix and POSIX-compliant systems. 
The shell works both interactively, and as a programming language
for batch files, or shell scripts.

     <br><dt>Short-Circuit<dd>The nature of the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> logical operators &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">||</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If the value of the entire expression is determinable from evaluating just
the lefthand side of these operators, the righthand side is not
evaluated. 
(See <a href="Boolean-Ops.html#Boolean-Ops">Boolean Ops</a>.)

     <br><dt>Side Effect<dd>A side effect occurs when an expression has an effect aside from merely
producing a value.  Assignment expressions, increment and decrement
expressions, and function calls have side effects. 
(See <a href="Assignment-Ops.html#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Ops</a>.)

     <br><dt>Single-Precision<dd>An internal representation of numbers that can have fractional parts. 
Single-precision numbers keep track of fewer digits than do double-precision
numbers, but operations on them are sometimes less expensive in terms of CPU time. 
This is the type used by some very old versions of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> to store
numeric values.  It is the C type <code>float</code>.

     <br><dt>Space<dd>The character generated by hitting the space bar on the keyboard.

     <br><dt>Special File<dd>A file name interpreted internally by <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>, instead of being handed
directly to the underlying operating system&mdash;for example, <samp><span class="file">/dev/stderr</span></samp>. 
(See <a href="Special-Files.html#Special-Files">Special Files</a>.)

     <br><dt>Stream Editor<dd>A program that reads records from an input stream and processes them one
or more at a time.  This is in contrast with batch programs, which may
expect to read their input files in entirety before starting to do
anything, as well as with interactive programs which require input from the
user.

     <br><dt>String<dd>A datum consisting of a sequence of characters, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">I am a
string</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Constant strings are written with double quotes in the
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language and may contain escape sequences. 
(See <a href="Escape-Sequences.html#Escape-Sequences">Escape Sequences</a>.)

     <br><dt>Tab<dd>The character generated by hitting the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key on the keyboard. 
It usually expands to up to eight spaces upon output.

     <br><dt>Text Domain<dd>A unique name that identifies an application. 
Used for grouping messages that are translated at runtime
into the local language.

     <br><dt>Timestamp<dd>A value in the &ldquo;seconds since the epoch&rdquo; format used by Unix
and POSIX systems.  Used for the <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> functions
<code>mktime</code>, <code>strftime</code>, and <code>systime</code>. 
See also &ldquo;Epoch&rdquo; and &ldquo;UTC.&rdquo;

AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.  It initially became popular in universities around
the world and later moved into commercial environments as a software
development system and network server system. There are many commercial
versions of Unix, as well as several work-alike systems whose source code
is freely available (such as GNU/Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD).

     <br><dt>UTC<dd>The accepted abbreviation for &ldquo;Universal Coordinated Time.&rdquo;
This is standard time in Greenwich, England, which is used as a
reference time for day and date calculations. 
See also &ldquo;Epoch&rdquo; and &ldquo;GMT.&rdquo;

     <br><dt>Whitespace<dd>A sequence of space, TAB, or newline characters occurring inside an input
record or a string.
