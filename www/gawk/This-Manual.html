<p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-terms-describing-24"></a>
The term <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> refers to a particular program as well as to the language you
use to tell this program what to do.  When we need to be careful, we call
the language &ldquo;the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language,&rdquo;
and the program &ldquo;the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> utility.&rdquo;
This Web page explains
both the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language and how to run the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> utility. 
The term <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp><dfn> program</dfn> refers to a program written by you in
the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programming language.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-_0040command_007bawk_007d-and-25"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bawk_007d_002c-_0040command_007bgawk_007d-and-26"></a><a name="index-POSIX-_0040command_007bawk_007d-27"></a>Primarily, this Web page explains the features of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>,
as defined in the POSIX standard.  It does so in the context of the
<samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> implementation.  While doing so, it also
attempts to describe important differences between <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>
and other <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> implementations.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Finally, any <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> features that are not in
the POSIX standard for <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> are noted.

   <p>This Web page has the difficult task of being both a tutorial and a reference. 
If you are a novice, feel free to skip over details that seem too complex. 
You should also ignore the many cross-references; they are for the
expert user and for the online Info version of the document.

   <p>There are
subsections labelled
as <strong>Advanced Notes</strong>
scattered throughout the Web page. 
They add a more complete explanation of points that are relevant, but not likely
to be of interest on first reading. 
All appear in the index, under the heading &ldquo;advanced features.&rdquo;

   <p>Most of the time, the examples use complete <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs. 
In some of the more advanced sections, only the part of the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>
program that illustrates the concept currently being described is shown.

   <p>While this Web page is aimed principally at people who have not been
exposed
to <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>, there is a lot of information here that even the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>
expert should find useful.  In particular, the description of POSIX
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> and the example programs in
<a href="Library-Functions.html#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>, and in
<a href="Sample-Programs.html#Sample-Programs">Sample Programs</a>,
should be of interest.

   <p><a href="Getting-Started.html#Getting-Started">Getting Started</a>,
provides the essentials you need to know to begin using <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>.

   <p><a href="Regexp.html#Regexp">Regexp</a>,
introduces regular expressions in general, and in particular the flavors
supported by POSIX <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>.

   <p><a href="Reading-Files.html#Reading-Files">Reading Files</a>,
describes how <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> reads your data. 
It introduces the concepts of records and fields, as well
as the <code>getline</code> command. 
I/O redirection is first described here.

   <p><a href="Printing.html#Printing">Printing</a>,
describes how <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs can produce output with
<code>print</code> and <code>printf</code>.

   <p><a href="Expressions.html#Expressions">Expressions</a>,
describes expressions, which are the basic building blocks
for getting most things done in a program.

   <p><a href="Patterns-and-Actions.html#Patterns-and-Actions">Patterns and Actions</a>,
describes how to write patterns for matching records, actions for
doing something when a record is matched, and the built-in variables
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> use.

   <p><a href="Arrays.html#Arrays">Arrays</a>,
covers <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>'s one-and-only data structure: associative arrays. 
Deleting array elements and whole arrays is also described, as well as
sorting arrays in <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>.

   <p><a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions</a>,
describes the built-in functions <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> provide, as well as how to define
your own functions.

   <p><a href="Internationalization.html#Internationalization">Internationalization</a>,
describes special features in <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> for translating program
messages into different languages at runtime.

   <p><a href="Advanced-Features.html#Advanced-Features">Advanced Features</a>,
describes a number of <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>-specific advanced features. 
Of particular note
are the abilities to have two-way communications with another process,
perform TCP/IP networking, and
profile your <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs.

   <p><a href="Invoking-Gawk.html#Invoking-Gawk">Invoking Gawk</a>,
describes how to run <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>, the meaning of its
command-line options, and how it finds <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>
program source files.

   <p><a href="Library-Functions.html#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>, and
<a href="Sample-Programs.html#Sample-Programs">Sample Programs</a>,
provide many sample <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs. 
Reading them allows you to see <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>
solving real problems.

   <p><a href="Language-History.html#Language-History">Language History</a>,
describes how the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> language has evolved since
first release to present.  It also describes how <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>
has acquired features over time.

   <p><a href="Installation.html#Installation">Installation</a>,
describes how to get <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>, how to compile it
under Unix, and how to compile and use it on different
non-Unix systems.  It also describes how to report bugs
in <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> and where to get three other freely
available implementations of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>.

   <p><a href="Notes.html#Notes">Notes</a>,
describes how to disable <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>'s extensions, as
well as how to contribute new code to <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>,
how to write extension libraries, and some possible
future directions for <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> development.

   <p><a href="Basic-Concepts.html#Basic-Concepts">Basic Concepts</a>,
provides some very cursory background material for those who
are completely unfamiliar with computer programming. 
Also centralized there is a discussion of some of the issues
surrounding floating-point numbers.

   <p>The
<a href="Glossary.html#Glossary">Glossary</a>,
defines most, if not all, the significant terms used
throughout the book. 
If you find terms that you aren't familiar with, try looking them up here.

   <p><a href="Copying.html#Copying">Copying</a>, and
<a href="GNU-Free-Documentation-License.html#GNU-Free-Documentation-License">GNU Free Documentation License</a>,
