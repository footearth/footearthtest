<h4 class="subsection">5.3.1 Using Variables in a Program</h4>

<p>Variables let you give names to values and refer to them later.  Variables
have already been used in many of the examples.  The name of a variable
must be a sequence of letters, digits, or underscores, and it may not begin
with a digit.  Case is significant in variable names; <code>a</code> and <code>A</code>
are distinct variables.

   <p>A variable name is a valid expression by itself; it represents the
variable's current value.  Variables are given new values with
<dfn>assignment operators</dfn>, <dfn>increment operators</dfn>, and
<dfn>decrement operators</dfn>. 
See <a href="Assignment-Ops.html#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Ops</a>. 
<!-- NEXT ED: Can also be changed by sub, gsub, split -->

   <p><a name="index-variables_002c-built_002din-639"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-initializing-640"></a>A few variables have special built-in meanings, such as <code>FS</code> (the
field separator), and <code>NF</code> (the number of fields in the current input
record).  See <a href="Built_002din-Variables.html#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</a>, for a list of the built-in variables. 
These built-in variables can be used and assigned just like all other
variables, but their values are also used or changed automatically by
<samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>.  All built-in variables' names are entirely uppercase.

   <p>Variables in <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> can be assigned either numeric or string values. 
The kind of value a variable holds can change over the life of a program. 
By default, variables are initialized to the empty string, which
is zero if converted to a number.  There is no need to
&ldquo;initialize&rdquo; each variable explicitly in <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>,
which is what you would do in C and in most other traditional languages.
