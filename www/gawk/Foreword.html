<h2 class="unnumbered">Foreword</h2>

<p>Arnold Robbins and I are good friends. We were introduced 11 years ago
by circumstances&mdash;and our favorite programming language, AWK. 
The circumstances started a couple of years
earlier. I was working at a new job and noticed an unplugged
Unix computer sitting in the corner.  No one knew how to use it,
and neither did I.  However,
a couple of days later it was running, and
I was <code>root</code> and the one-and-only user. 
That day, I began the transition from statistician to Unix programmer.

   <p>On one of many trips to the library or bookstore in search of
books on Unix, I found the gray AWK book, a.k.a. Aho, Kernighan and
Weinberger, <cite>The AWK Programming Language</cite>, Addison-Wesley,
1988.  AWK's simple programming paradigm&mdash;find a pattern in the
input and then perform an action&mdash;often reduced complex or tedious
data manipulations to few lines of code.  I was excited to try my
hand at programming in AWK.

   <p>Alas,  the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> on my computer was a limited version of the
language described in the AWK book.  I discovered that my computer
had &ldquo;old <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>&rdquo; and the AWK book described &ldquo;new <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>.&rdquo;
I learned that this was typical; the old version refused to step
aside or relinquish its name.  If a system had a new <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>, it was
invariably called <samp><span class="command">nawk</span></samp>, and few systems had it. 
The best way to get a new <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> was to <samp><span class="command">ftp</span></samp> the source code for
<samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> from <code>prep.ai.mit.edu</code>.  <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> was a version of
new <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> written by David Trueman and Arnold, and available under
the GNU General Public License.

   <p>(Incidentally,
it's no longer difficult to find a new <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>. <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> ships with
Linux, and you can download binaries or source code for almost
any system; my wife uses <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> on her VMS box.)

   <p>My Unix system started out unplugged from the wall; it certainly was not
plugged into a network.  So, oblivious to the existence of <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>
and the Unix community in general, and desiring a new <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>, I wrote
my own, called <samp><span class="command">mawk</span></samp>. 
Before I was finished I knew about <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>,
but it was too late to stop, so I eventually posted
to a <code>comp.sources</code> newsgroup.

   <p>A few days after my posting, I got a friendly email
from Arnold introducing
himself.   He suggested we share design and algorithms and
attached a draft of the POSIX standard so
that I could update <samp><span class="command">mawk</span></samp> to support language extensions added
after publication of the AWK book.

   <p>Frankly, if our roles had
been reversed, I would not have been so open and we probably would
have never met.  I'm glad we did meet. 
He is an AWK expert's AWK expert and a genuinely nice person. 
Arnold contributes significant amounts of his
expertise and time to the Free Software Foundation.

   <p>This book is the <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> reference manual, but at its core it
is a book about AWK programming that
will appeal to a wide audience. 
It is a definitive reference to the AWK language as defined by the
1987 Bell Labs release and codified in the 1992 POSIX Utilities
standard.

   <p>On the other hand, the novice AWK programmer can study
a wealth of practical programs that emphasize
the power of AWK's basic idioms:
data driven control-flow, pattern matching with regular expressions,
and associative arrays. 
Those looking for something new can try out <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>'s
interface to network protocols via special <samp><span class="file">/inet</span></samp> files.

   <p>The programs in this book make clear that an AWK program is
typically much smaller and faster to develop than
a counterpart written in C. 
Consequently, there is often a payoff to prototype an
algorithm or design in AWK to get it running quickly and expose
problems early. Often, the interpreted performance is adequate
and the AWK prototype becomes the product.

   <p>The new <samp><span class="command">pgawk</span></samp> (profiling <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>), produces
program execution counts. 
I recently experimented with an algorithm that for
n lines of input, exhibited
~ C n^2
performance, while
theory predicted
~ C n log n
behavior. A few minutes poring
over the <samp><span class="file">awkprof.out</span></samp> profile pinpointed the problem to
a single line of code.  <samp><span class="command">pgawk</span></samp> is a welcome addition to
my programmer's toolbox.

   <p>Arnold has distilled over a decade of experience writing and
using AWK programs, and developing <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>, into this book.  If you use
AWK or want to learn how, then read this book.
