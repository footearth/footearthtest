<a name="index-troubleshooting_002c-_0040command_007bgawk_007d_002c-bug-reports-1938"></a>If you have problems with <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> or think that you have found a bug,
please report it to the developers; we cannot promise to do anything
but we might well want to fix it.

   <p>Before reporting a bug, make sure you have actually found a real bug. 
Carefully reread the documentation and see if it really says you can do
what you're trying to do.  If it's not clear whether you should be able
to do something or not, report that too; it's a bug in the documentation!

   <p>Before reporting a bug or trying to fix it yourself, try to isolate it
to the smallest possible <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> program and input data file that
reproduces the problem.  Then send us the program and data file,
some idea of what kind of Unix system you're using,
the compiler you used to compile <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>, and the exact results
<samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> gave you.  Also say what you expected to occur; this helps
us decide whether the problem is really in the documentation.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bbug_002dgawk_0040_0040gnu_002eorg_007d-bug-reporting-address-1939"></a><a name="index-email-address-for-bug-reports_002c-_0040code_007bbug_002dgawk_0040_0040gnu_002eorg_007d-1940"></a><a name="index-bug-reports_002c-email-address_002c-_0040code_007bbug_002dgawk_0040_0040gnu_002eorg_007d-1941"></a>Once you have a precise problem, send email to <a href="mailto:bug-gawk@gnu.org">bug-gawk@gnu.org</a>.

   <p><a name="index-Robbins_002c-Arnold-1942"></a>Please include the version number of <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> you are using. 
You can get this information with the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gawk --version</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Using this address automatically sends a carbon copy of your
mail to me.  If necessary, I can be reached directly at
<a href="mailto:arnold@skeeve.com">arnold@skeeve.com</a>.  The bug reporting address is preferred since the
email list is archived at the GNU Project. 
<em>All email should be in English, since that is my native language.</em>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcomp_002elang_002eawk_007d-newsgroup-1943"></a><strong>Caution:</strong> Do <em>not</em> try to report bugs in <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> by
posting to the Usenet/Internet newsgroup <code>comp.lang.awk</code>. 
While the <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> developers do occasionally read this newsgroup,
there is no guarantee that we will see your posting.  The steps described
above are the official recognized ways for reporting bugs.

   <blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> Many distributions of GNU/Linux and the various BSD-based operating systems
have their own bug reporting systems.  If you report a bug using your distribution's
bug reporting system, <em>please</em> also send a copy to <a href="mailto:bug-gawk@gnu.org">bug-gawk@gnu.org</a>.

   <p>This is for two reasons.  First, while some distributions forward
bug reports &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; to the GNU mailing list, many don't, so there is a good
chance that the <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>  maintainer won't even see the bug report!  Second,
mail to the GNU list is archived, and having everything at the GNU project
keeps things self-contained and not dependant on other web sites. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Non-bug suggestions are always welcome as well.  If you have questions
about things that are unclear in the documentation or are just obscure
features, ask me; I will try to help you out, although I
may not have the time to fix the problem.  You can send me electronic
mail at the Internet address noted previously.

   <p>If you find bugs in one of the non-Unix ports of <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>, please send
an electronic mail message to the person who maintains that port.  They
are named in the following list, as well as in the <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> file in the <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp>
distribution.  Information in the <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp> file should be considered
authoritative if it conflicts with this Web page.

   <p>The people maintaining the non-Unix ports of <samp><span class="command">gawk</span></samp> are
as follows:
