<h2 class="chapter">13 Practical <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> Programs</h2>

<!-- STARTOFRANGE awkpex -->
<p><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bawk_007d-programs_002c-examples-of-1755"></a>
<a href="Library-Functions.html#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>,
presents the idea that reading programs in a language contributes to
learning that language.  This chapter continues that theme,
presenting a potpourri of <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp> programs for your reading
enjoyment. 
There are three sections. 
The first describes how to run the programs presented
in this chapter.

   <p>The second presents <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>
versions of several common POSIX utilities. 
These are programs that you are hopefully already familiar with,
and therefore, whose problems are understood. 
By reimplementing these programs in <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>,
you can focus on the <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>-related aspects of solving
the programming problem.

   <p>The third is a grab bag of interesting programs. 
These solve a number of different data-manipulation and management
problems.  Many of the programs are short, which emphasizes <samp><span class="command">awk</span></samp>'s
ability to do a lot in just a few lines of code.

   <p>Many of these programs use the library functions presented in
<a href="Library-Functions.html#Library-Functions">Library Functions</a>.
