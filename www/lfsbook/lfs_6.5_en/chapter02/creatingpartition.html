      </h1>
      <p>
        Like most other operating systems, LFS is usually installed on a
        dedicated partition. The recommended approach to building an LFS
        system is to use an available empty partition or, if you have enough
        unpartitioned space, to create one.
      </p>
      <p>
        A minimal system requires a partition of around 1.3 gigabytes (GB).
        This is enough to store all the source tarballs and compile the
        packages. However, if the LFS system is intended to be the primary
        Linux system, additional software will probably be installed which
        will require additional space (2-3 GB). The LFS system itself will
        not take up this much room. A large portion of this requirement is to
        provide sufficient free temporary storage. Compiling packages can
        require a lot of disk space which will be reclaimed after the package
        is installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because there is not always enough Random Access Memory (RAM)
        available for compilation processes, it is a good idea to use a small
        disk partition as <code class="systemitem">swap</code> space. This is
        used by the kernel to store seldom-used data and leave more memory
        available for active processes. The <code class=
        "systemitem">swap</code> partition for an LFS system can be the same
        as the one used by the host system, in which case it is not necessary
        to create another one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start a disk partitioning program such as <span class=
        "command"><strong>cfdisk</strong></span> or <span class=
        "command"><strong>fdisk</strong></span> with a command line option
        naming the hard disk on which the new partition will be
        created&mdash;for example <code class="filename">/dev/hda</code> for
        the primary Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) disk. Create a Linux
        native partition and a <code class="systemitem">swap</code>
        partition, if needed. Please refer to <code class=
        "filename">cfdisk(8)</code> or <code class="filename">fdisk(8)</code>
        if you do not yet know how to use the programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember the designation of the new partition (e.g., <code class=
        "filename">hda5</code>). This book will refer to this as the LFS
        partition. Also remember the designation of the <code class=
        "systemitem">swap</code> partition. These names will be needed later
        for the <code class="filename">/etc/fstab</code> file.
